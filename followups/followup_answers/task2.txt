Q2. Explain what you understand of the approach to hosting apps in the course.

From the Pipelines course, I learned that the approach to hosting applications should be automated using a pipeline
wherever possible. Automation ensures that deployments are reliable and consistent, with the same steps executed every
time an app is deployed. The benefits of this approach include:

- Automated validation checks before deployment.
- Triggered deployments on every commit (or according to configured rules).
- Time savings and reduced errors.
- Minimised repetitive manual tasks.
- Consistency across different environments, helping to ensure that the app behaves as expected in both development
and production.
- Consistent monitoring and logging to maintain reliability and quickly address any issues that arise.

Due to this, creating a strong deployment pipeline, which serves as the foundation for deploying an app, is crucial.
It helps give confidence in the code you write and reassurance that the app is behaving as intended.

Q5. Identify a problem or improvement you could do on a pipeline on your delivery. What did your team decide to do to fix
or improve it (even if it hasn't been prioritised yet)?

In my current delivery, we encountered a problem with one of the testing pipelines we had created using GitHub Workflows. 
Our end-to-end (E2E) tests worked locally but were failing in the pipeline. To troubleshoot, we examined the logs and metrics 
from the failing pipeline and compared its environment with our local setup. We discovered that Playwright and its dependencies 
needed to be explicitly installed in the pipeline. Adding a step to install Playwright before running E2E tests made the pipeline 
fully functional and ensured the tests consistently passed.

This experience highlighted how useful logs and metrics are for troubleshooting. They provide insight into where the pipeline 
is failing and guide you on what to investigate. By carefully analysing these logs, we were able to identify the problem and 
get our pipeline working without errors.

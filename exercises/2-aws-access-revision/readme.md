# aws access

## Tasks

Knowing what you already know about connecting to the aws sandbox and running command line arguments

- review anything in the tips documentation you want to brush up on
- connect to the aws sandbox in a terminal window
- run the aws command line command to retrieve a list of s3 buckets on the account

## Notes
In the command line: aws-vault exec mt-playground -- aws s3api list-buckets (for nicely ordered json buckets)
aws-vault exec mt-playground -- aws s3 ls
